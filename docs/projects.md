      The goal of the OAuth Security Workshop (OSW) is to improve the security
      of OAuth and related Internet protocols by a direct exchange
      between academic researchers, IETF OAuth Working Group members
      and industry. The OSW was jointly initiated by the OAuth Working
      Group and my group at the University of Trier after we
      communicated our newly found attacks to the working group in
      2015. I'm one of the main organizers of the events since 2019.

      Founded by me and Guido Schmitz in 2012, Pi and More has become
      the largest Raspberry Pi community event in Germany. At Pi and
      More, beginners and experts meet for talks, workshops, and
      projects focussing on the Raspberry Pi, embedded systems and
      microcontrollers. We created the association "CMD - Computer,
      Menschen, Dinge e.V." to support the event.

      The Security Barcamp Cologne is an open conference
      (unconference) where topics are decided on the spot. It is aimed
      at everyone with an interest in application, network, and IT
      security and privacy. Together with two friends, we are
      currently planning the first edition of the SecCamp for June
      2019.

      The Repair Café Trier is a place where experts volunteer to fix
      and repair things: Furniture, clothing, bicycles, and, of
      course, electronics and computers. Fixing furniture and clothing
      is not where I excel, but I helped to build the Repair Café and
      ran the computer and electronics area during the first four
      years.

      The Maschinendeck is Trier's first hacker- and makerspace. We
      founded the Maschinendeck e.V. to create a space for creative
      nerd culture.
