In this talk, I present the SD-JWT Reference Implementation that was created as part of my work on the SD-JWT specification. The library serves multiple purposes:

- It is a reference implementation of the SD-JWT specification and shows what an interface to an SD-JWT library can look like.
- It is used to test and demonstrate new features.
- The library can be used to create test cases for checking other SD-JWT implementations.
- All examples in the SD-JWT library are created using this library.

I proposed the SD-JWT library for adoption by the OpenWalletFoundation (OWF).
