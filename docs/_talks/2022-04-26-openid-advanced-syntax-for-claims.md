This specification defines an **extension of OpenID Connect** to enable new features for requesting and receiving Claims and meta-information about Claims. There are two components that can be implemented independently or together, "Selective Abort and Omit" and "Transformed Claims". These components enable additional data minimization requirements to be expressed between the Relying Party and the Identity Provider thus helping both parties comply with business requirements, policies and regulatory requirements relating to limiting data being transferred to that which is needed.
