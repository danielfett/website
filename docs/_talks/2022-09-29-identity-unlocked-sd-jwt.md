In this episode of Identity, Unlocked, I give a brief overview of existing standards in the world of privacy-preserving measures (such as selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs or ZKP, etc.) that are emerging to augment existing technologies and enable new scenarios in the identity space. Together with Vittorio I then deep-dive into the [SD-JWT specification](/publications/2022-05-01-selective-disclosure/) which I'm co-authoring at the IETF. SD-JWT, or Selective Disclosure JWT, offers a simple and easy-to-adopt approach to produce JWTs capable of supporting selective disclosure.
